# The Wild Oasis

Welcome to The Wild Oasis internal application! This custom-built application is designed to manage all aspects of our boutique hotel, from bookings and cabins to guest management. The hotel currently features 8 luxurious wooden cabins, with plans to expand in the future.

## Project Overview

This internal application is crucial for the daily operations of The Wild Oasis. It allows staff to efficiently check in guests, manage bookings, and oversee cabin availability. The application's architecture is built with modern web technologies, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.

### Future Development

Looking ahead, we aim to develop a customer-facing website that will allow customers to book their stays directly, leveraging the same API used by the internal application.
